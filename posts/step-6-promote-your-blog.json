There are lots of great bloggers out there that no one has ever heard about, simply because they don’t know how, or just don’t want, to promote their blog.\n\nThe most important tip I can give you about promoting your blog is to not be shy about telling people about your blog!\n\nI have heard from many bloggers who tell me that they don’t promote their blog simply because they don’t feel it is worthy of promotion. They say things like “I don’t have enough posts yet” or “I need to work on my site design first”.\n\nDon’t do this to yourself! If you have put in the time to setup a great site and with great content, then you need to tell people about it. Be proud of the work you have put in.\n\nSo just how do you promote your blog? Well, it turns out the most effective methods of promotion are free!",
