# Firebase.json Rewrites Fix

**Date**: October 16, 2025 07:20 UTC  
**Issue**: Incorrect rewrites pointing to non-existent files  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## ❌ What Was Wrong:

### Incorrect Rewrites:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/page/**",
    "destination": "/page/index.html"  // ❌ This file doesn't exist!
  },
  {
    "source": "/blog/**",
    "destination": "/blog/index.html"  // ❌ This file doesn't exist!
  }
]
```

### Actual File Structure:
```
page/
  ├── about.html ✅
  ├── services.html ✅
  ├── portfolio.html ✅
  ├── contact.html ✅
  └── blog.html ✅

blog/
  ├── essential-web-design-trends-2025.html ✅
  └── index.json (metadata, not HTML)
```

**Problem**: Rewrites were redirecting ALL `/page/*` and `/blog/*` URLs to non-existent `index.html` files, causing 404 errors or "Site Not Found" responses.

---

## ✅ The Fix:

### Removed Rewrites Entirely:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": ".",
    "ignore": [...],
    "headers": [...],  // No rewrites!
    "cleanUrls": true,
    "trailingSlash": false
  }
}
```

### Why This Works:

Firebase's `"cleanUrls": true` already handles URL routing:

**Before Fix (with incorrect rewrites):**
```
/page/about → /page/index.html → 404 ❌
/page/services → /page/index.html → 404 ❌
/blog/essential-web-design-trends-2025 → /blog/index.html → 404 ❌
```

**After Fix (no rewrites, cleanUrls only):**
```
/page/about → /page/about.html → 200 ✅
/page/services → /page/services.html → 200 ✅
/blog/essential-web-design-trends-2025 → /blog/essential-web-design-trends-2025.html → 200 ✅
```

## 🎯 Impact on Custom Domain Issue:

### Potential Connection:
The incorrect rewrites may have contributed to the "Site Not Found" error on www.rs999.in because:

1. Firebase was trying to serve non-existent files
2. This could confuse the CDN/routing layer
3. May have caused Firebase to show error page instead of content

### Expected Improvement:
With correct configuration:
- ✅ All URLs now route to actual existing files
- ✅ No 404 errors from incorrect rewrites
- ✅ Cleaner Firebase hosting configuration
- 🤞 May help with custom domain SSL/routing

## 📊 Verification:

### Test Results:
```bash
# Test page URLs
curl -I https://rs999static.web.app/page/about
# Result: HTTP/2 200 ✅

# Test blog URLs
curl -I https://rs999static.web.app/blog/essential-web-design-trends-2025
# Result: HTTP/2 200 ✅
```

### Files Deployed:
```
✅ 709 files deployed
✅ All pages accessible
✅ Clean URLs working
✅ No 404 errors
```

## 🔄 What Changed:

### firebase.json:
```diff
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": ".",
    "ignore": [...],
-   "rewrites": [
-     {
-       "source": "/page/**",
-       "destination": "/page/index.html"
-     },
-     {
-       "source": "/blog/**",
-       "destination": "/blog/index.html"
-     }
-   ],
    "headers": [...],
    "cleanUrls": true,
    "trailingSlash": false
  }
}
```

## 📝 When Do You Need Rewrites?

### You DON'T need rewrites for:
- ❌ Simple static sites with `.html` files
- ❌ Sites using `cleanUrls: true` (handles extension removal)
- ❌ Direct file routing

### You DO need rewrites for:
- ✅ Single Page Applications (SPA) - route all to index.html
- ✅ Custom 404 pages - fallback routing
- ✅ API proxying - redirect to functions
- ✅ Complex routing patterns

### Examples of Valid Rewrites:

#### SPA (React/Vue/Angular):
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "**",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

#### Custom 404:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "**",
    "destination": "/404.html"
  }
]
```

#### API Proxy:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/api/**",
    "function": "api"
  }
]
```

## ✅ Current Configuration (Optimal):

### firebase.json (Corrected):
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": ".",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**",

      "package-lock.json",
      "tailwind.config.js",
      "DEPLOYMENT_20i.md",
      "PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md",
      "PAGESPEED_FIXES.md",
      "PAGESPEED_UPDATE_2.md"
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|webp|avif|svg|ico)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(css|js)",

          }
        ]
      },

        "source": "**/*.@(woff|woff2|ttf|otf)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",

          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(html|json)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate"
