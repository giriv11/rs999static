## 🔍 Why You're Seeing "Site Not Found"

### Current Situation:

**Firebase Console Status**:
- Domain: www.rs999.in
- Status: ✅ **Connected**
- DNS: ✅ Verified
- SSL: 🟡 **Provisioning** (not "Active" yet)

**SSL Certificate Issue**:
```
Current Certificate: CN=firebaseapp.com ❌
Expected Certificate: CN=www.rs999.in ⏳
Status: Certificate being provisioned by Firebase
```

**Why "Site Not Found" Shows**:
When the SSL certificate doesn't match the domain name (www.rs999.in vs firebaseapp.com), Firebase's CDN shows a placeholder "Site Not Found" page instead of your actual site. This is a **security feature** to prevent certificate mismatch errors.

## 🎯 What's Happening Right Now:

### Behind the Scenes (Automatic):

1. ✅ **DNS Verification** (COMPLETE)
   - Your CNAME: www.rs999.in → rs999static.web.app
   - Firebase verified this ✅

2. ✅ **Domain Connection** (COMPLETE)
   - Firebase Console shows "Connected" ✅

3. 🟡 **SSL Certificate Request** (IN PROGRESS)
   - Firebase requested certificate from Let's Encrypt/Google
   - Certificate Authority is validating your domain
   - New certificate: CN=www.rs999.in (being issued)

4. ⏳ **SSL Certificate Deployment** (PENDING)
   - Once issued, Firebase will deploy to all CDN edges
   - Will replace firebaseapp.com certificate
   - Takes 15 min - 24 hours (usually 1-4 hours)

5. ⏳ **Site Activation** (PENDING)
   - After SSL deploys, "Site Not Found" will disappear
   - Your actual website will load at www.rs999.in
   - Same content as https://rs999static.web.app

## ✅ Evidence Your Site Is Ready:

### Test 1: Firebase URL Works
```bash
curl https://rs999static.web.app | grep "<title>"
# Output: <title>₹3599 Low Cost Website Design &amp; Development Company in India</title>

# Output: rs999static.web.app.
✅ DNS is correct!
```

---

## 🚀 What Will Happen Next:

### Stage 1: SSL Certificate Issues (5 min - 2 hours)
Firebase/Let's Encrypt will issue a new certificate:
```
Certificate Details:
- Common Name: www.rs999.in
- SANs: www.rs999.in
- Issuer: Let's Encrypt or Google Trust Services
- Valid: 90 days (auto-renewed)
```

### Stage 2: Certificate Deploys to CDN (10-30 minutes)
Firebase will push the certificate to all global edge locations:
- North America
- Europe
- Asia Pacific
- All other regions

### Stage 3: Your Site Goes Live (Instant)
Once the certificate is deployed:
```
Before:
https://www.rs999.in → "Site Not Found" ❌

After:
https://www.rs999.in → Your Rs999 homepage ✅
```
