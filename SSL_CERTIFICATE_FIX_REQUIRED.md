# URGENT: SSL Certificate Issue - Manual Fix Required

**Date**: October 16, 2025 07:15 UTC  
**Issue**: Wrong SSL certificate being served  
**Status**: 🔴 **REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION IN FIREBASE CONSOLE**

---

## 🔴 Current Problem:

### SSL Certificate Status:
```
❌ Certificate Common Name: firebaseapp.com
❌ SANs: firebaseapp.com, *.firebaseapp.com
✅ Certificate Valid: Yes (trusted)
❌ Matches www.rs999.in: NO

Result: "Site Not Found" error
```

### What This Means:
Firebase is serving a **generic wildcard certificate** (`*.firebaseapp.com`) instead of a **custom certificate** for your domain (`www.rs999.in`).

---

## 🔍 Root Cause:

Firebase Console shows domain as "Connected" but the SSL certificate provisioning **did not trigger properly**. This can happen when:

1. Domain was added but SSL provisioning stalled
2. Firebase is still verifying domain ownership
3. There's a configuration mismatch in Firebase Console

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Manual Steps in Firebase Console

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
Go to: **https://console.firebase.google.com/project/rs999static/hosting/sites**

### Step 2: Navigate to Custom Domains
1. Click on your site: **rs999static**
2. Click on **"Custom domains"** tab (or section)
3. You should see: **www.rs999.in**

### Step 3: Check Current Status
Look at the domain status. It will show one of these:

#### Option A: Status shows "Connected" but SSL says "Provisioning"
- **Action**: Just wait 1-2 more hours
- SSL is being processed
- No action needed

#### Option B: Status shows "Connected" and SSL says "Active"
- **Problem**: Certificate is wrong despite "Active" status
- **Action**: Go to Step 4 (force refresh)

#### Option C: Status shows "Needs Setup" or error
- **Action**: Complete the verification process
- Follow Firebase's instructions

### Step 4: Force SSL Certificate Refresh
If SSL shows "Active" but wrong certificate is being served:

1. Click **"..."** (three dots) next to **www.rs999.in**
2. Select **"Delete domain"** or **"Remove"**
3. Confirm deletion
4. **WAIT 10 MINUTES** (important!)
5. Click **"Add custom domain"** again
6. Enter: **www.rs999.in**
7. Click **"Continue"**
8. Firebase will verify DNS (instant - CNAME already exists)
9. Click **"Finish"**
10. **WAIT 1-2 HOURS** for SSL to provision

---

## 🎯 What to Look For in Firebase Console:

### Correct Configuration Should Show:

```
Custom Domains:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Domain          │ Status       │ SSL Status  │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────┤
│ www.rs999.in    │ Connected ✅ │ Provisioning│
│                 │              │ or Active ✅ │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘

When SSL Status = "Active", certificate should be for www.rs999.in
```

### Common Mistakes:

❌ **Wrong**: Added `rs999.in` instead of `www.rs999.in`
✅ **Correct**: Added `www.rs999.in`

❌ **Wrong**: Added domain but didn't complete setup wizard
✅ **Correct**: Completed all steps in setup wizard

## 📱 Alternative: Check Firebase Console Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Navigate to Hosting
```
Firebase Console
└── Build (left sidebar)
    └── Hosting
        └── Sites tab
            └── rs999static
                └── Custom domains
```

### Screenshot 2: Domain List
You should see a table with:
- Domain name: www.rs999.in
- Status: Connected
- Actions: [...] menu

### Screenshot 3: SSL Status
Click on the domain or [...] menu to see:
- DNS Status: ✅ Verified
- SSL Certificate: Active or Provisioning
- Certificate Details: Should show www.rs999.in

---

## 🧪 Test Commands:

### Check if new certificate is issued:
```bash
# Run every 30 minutes
echo | openssl s_client -servername www.rs999.in \
  -connect www.rs999.in:443 2>/dev/null | \
  grep "subject=" | grep "www.rs999.in"

# When ready, will output:
# subject=CN=www.rs999.in ✅
```

### Test website:
```bash
curl -I https://www.rs999.in 2>&1 | grep "HTTP"

# When ready, will show:
# HTTP/2 200 OK ✅
```

## ❓ FAQ:

### Q: Will I lose my deployment?
**A: NO!** Your 699 files stay deployed. Removing the domain only affects the domain connection, not your files.

### Q: Will www.rs999.in stop working?
**A: It's already not working properly** (showing "Site Not Found"). This fix will make it work.

### Q: What about rs999static.web.app?
**A: Still works!** That URL is unaffected. Your site is always available there.

### Q: How long should I wait?
**A: 10 minutes after removal**, then re-add. After re-adding, wait **1-2 hours** for SSL.

### Q: What if it still doesn't work?
**A: Contact Firebase Support** with:
- Project: rs999static
- Domain: www.rs999.in
- Issue: SSL certificate not provisioning for custom domain
- Evidence: Certificate shows firebaseapp.com instead of www.rs999.in

## 📈 Comparison:

### What Works Now:
```
URL: https://rs999static.web.app
Certificate: firebaseapp.com ✅ (correct for this URL)
Content: Your website ✅
Status: 200 OK ✅
```

### What Should Work:
```
URL: https://www.rs999.in
Certificate: www.rs999.in ✅ (correct for this URL)
Content: Same website ✅
Status: 200 OK ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Summary:

**The Problem**: Firebase is serving a generic certificate instead of a custom one for your domain.

**The Solution**: Remove the domain from Firebase Console, wait 10 minutes, then re-add it. This forces Firebase to provision a new SSL certificate specifically for www.rs999.in.

**Your Action**: Go to Firebase Console and remove/re-add the domain.

**Timeline**: 1-4 hours after re-adding.

**Guarantee**: Your files are safe, deployment is intact, this only affects the domain connection.

**Status**: 🔴 **MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED IN FIREBASE CONSOLE**  
**Action**: Remove and re-add www.rs999.in domain
