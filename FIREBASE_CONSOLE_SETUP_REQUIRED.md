# URGENT: Complete Domain Setup in Firebase Console

## 🔴 Issue Found:
Your CNAME is configured correctly, BUT Firebase is showing "Site Not Found" because the domain verification is incomplete in Firebase Console.

---

## ✅ DNS Status:
```bash
dig www.rs999.in CNAME +short
# Output: rs999static.web.app. ✅ CORRECT
```

## ❌ Firebase Status:
```
curl -k https://www.rs999.in
# Output: "Site Not Found" ❌
```

**Reason**: Domain added to DNS but not verified/activated in Firebase Console.

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
Go to: **https://console.firebase.google.com/project/rs999static/hosting/sites**

### Step 2: Connect Custom Domain
1. Click on your site: **rs999static**
2. Look for **"Add custom domain"** or **"Custom domains"** section
3. Click **"Add custom domain"**

### Step 3: Enter Your Domain
```
Enter domain: www.rs999.in
```
Click **"Continue"**

### Step 4: Verify DNS Records
Firebase will check your DNS and show:
```
✅ DNS records found
   www.rs999.in → rs999static.web.app
```
Click **"Verify"** or **"Continue"**

### Step 5: Wait for Activation
Firebase will show:
- Status: Verifying → Pending → **Connected**
- SSL Status: Provisioning → **Active**

**Time**: 5-30 minutes

---

## 📸 What to Look For in Console:

### Before Setup:
```
Custom domains section:
[ ] No domains connected
[+ Add custom domain]
```

### During Setup:
```
Domain: www.rs999.in
Status: Pending verification
DNS: Checking...
```

### After Setup (Target):
```
Domain: www.rs999.in
Status: Connected ✅
SSL: Active ✅
```

---

## ⚡ Alternative: Use Firebase CLI (If Available)

Try running:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/2025/Rs999Static
firebase hosting:domain:setup www.rs999.in
```

**Note**: This command may not be available in all Firebase CLI versions. If it fails, use the Console method above.

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands:

### After Firebase Console Setup:

```bash
# Wait 5 minutes, then test
curl -I https://www.rs999.in

# Should return:
# HTTP/2 200 OK
# (no "Site Not Found")
```

```bash
# Check SSL certificate
echo | openssl s_client -servername www.rs999.in \
  -connect www.rs999.in:443 2>/dev/null | \
  openssl x509 -noout -subject

# Should return:
# subject=CN=www.rs999.in (eventually)
```

---

## 📋 Troubleshooting:

### If Firebase Console Says "Invalid Domain":
- Make sure you enter: `www.rs999.in` (with www)
- NOT: `rs999.in` (without www) - add that separately if needed

### If Firebase Can't Verify DNS:
```bash
# Double-check CNAME is correct
dig www.rs999.in CNAME +short
# Must return: rs999static.web.app.

# If incorrect, update in your domain registrar
```

### If Still Shows "Site Not Found" After 1 Hour:
1. Remove domain from Firebase Console
2. Wait 10 minutes
3. Re-add domain
4. Wait 30 minutes

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline:

| Action | Time | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| CNAME configured | ✅ DONE | 0 min |
| DNS propagated | ✅ DONE | 2 hrs ago |
| **Add domain in Firebase Console** | ⏳ **NOW** | **5 min** |
| Firebase verifies DNS | ⏳ Automatic | 5-15 min |
| SSL certificate provisions | ⏳ Automatic | 15min-4hrs |
| Site fully live | ⏳ Pending | After SSL |

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria:

### When Setup is Complete:

✅ **Firebase Console shows**:
```
Domain: www.rs999.in
Status: Connected
SSL: Active
```

✅ **Browser test**:
```
Visit: https://www.rs999.in
